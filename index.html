  Assignment 01: Taxi Driver (1976)
</h2>
<section>
    <ol>
      <li>Brief 
        <ul>In this article, I discuss the opening scene of this film, focusing on the protagonist Travis's unique perspective and the director's use of color to convey his view on society. The narrative unfolds through Travis's eyes, creating a narrow and tense perspective for the audience, blurring the line between his visual characteristics and the film's abstraction. Travis's chronic loneliness, influenced by his experiences in the Vietnam War and the gritty reality of New York at night, shapes his worldview, portraying a confused and chaotic social atmosphere through the lens of an "insignificant" lonely individual.

<h2 class="acc-header">Assignment 02: Rubble Films </h2>
<section>
<ol>
  <li>Brief 
    <ul>I explore rubble films inspired by "The Murderers Are Among Us (1946)," the first film produced in Germany after World War II. Directed by Wolfgang Staudte, the movie falls into the category of "TrÃ¼mmerfilm" or "Rubble Film," utilizing ruins to symbolize the trauma caused by war. Staudte skillfully incorporates German expressionism techniques, such as tilted angles and high-contrast lighting, to convey the eerie atmosphere reflecting postwar trauma. The film explores themes of revenge, justice, and the blurred lines between good and evil, marking a significant development under the category of rubble films in the reemergence of German cinema after the war.

<h2 class="acc-header">Assignment 03: Dark City (1998)</h2>
<section>
  <ol>
    <li>Brief
      <ul>  
In my exploration of Alex Proyas' "Dark City" (1998), I delved into the intricate interplay of epistemological and ontological challenges within a suspenseful thriller. The film, paralleling the classic "Metropolis" (1927), questions the essence of humanity and the repercussions of challenging established systems.</br>                
Despite its visual appeal and atmospheric soundtrack by Trevor Jones, "Dark City" falls short in thoroughly analyzing the profound questions it raises. The film tends to prioritize the linear plot over a deeper exploration, facing criticism for overlooking the intricacies of human interactions within its complex narrative. While an exciting journey, it may not stand alongside timeless classics in the realm of science fiction.
      </ul>

<section>
  <ol>
    <li>Brief
      <ul>In my exploration of "Chungking Express," I explore the distinctiveness of Hong Kong's urban landscape through Wong Kar-wai's cinematic perspective. Through handheld photography and casual long shots, the film captures the intricacies of relationships and urban solitude within the iconic Chungking Mansions. By challenging stereotypes about Chungking Mansions, I emphasize its global significance within Hong Kong's cultural tapestry, illustrating how the film reshapes the city's narrative through my own cinematic lens.

    <li>Brief
      <ul>This is my thesis project. This article discusses the emergence of "Gopnik" culture at the turn of the 21st century and its evolution from Russian street gangs in 1992. This subculture is deeply rooted in Russian identity and has influenced social class, masculinity, and had an international impact in a rapidly changing world. I also explores how Gosha Rubchinskiy integrated Gopnik aesthetics into popular culture, transforming Gopniks from a marginalized group in Russian society into a globally recognized aesthetic.
